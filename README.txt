Survey Test System - Homework 4

- Same as Homework 3, except with TTS.
- I still display console output with TTS, so that it's clear to what is being said.
 (You can comment out line 25 in OutputInquiry.java file, to avoid console output)
- The TTS is only used on a "Display" option per my interpretation of the assignment, 
 although a trivial change can be done to change the output to TTS for other options.
