Survey Test System - Homework 3

- In regards to bugs, there might be some undesired outcome in some special cases,
 but I haven't been able to find any.
- In regards to satisfying the specifications for this homework, I think that I have everything
 that was listed.  
- To run, copy the file structure/files from the .zip and run it.
- Examples of survey and test are included. Each one has at least 3 responses.

In regards to Homework 2:
"Essay shouldn’t ask for any answers" ->
It doesn't ask for any answers while creating, but admin is asked to enter number of answers. (Shouldn't have lost a point.)

"Menu selection says “Exit” but really just goes back a menu, operation should do what it says it will do." ->
I simply changed the text to "Go back".
